          <p id="blockTxt">I began to enjoy coding when I took a Web Publishing course as part of the Graphic Design program at my High School. When I was actively taking that class I found out fairly quickly that not only was Web Dev/Coding something that I thoroughly enjoyed, but I was good at it as well. After I graduated High School I started a consumer product business with my Dad. I fell in love with Product R&amp;D. I loved the prototyping stage of things. I was able to put my problem-solving skills into a very direct example of "Let's try this and if this doesn't work let's try that". So I ended up going to college for Mechanical Engineering. I ended up taking a couple of semesters off after my first year because our business was starting to gain traction and they needed help. During my time that I spent working full time for our company I was tasked with making eMail signatures that would always show, and very responsive. Because of the requirements I was given for creating the email signatures I was given I turned to HTML and CSS for the first time since my Web Publishing class in High School and when I finished coding out all of the email signatures I realized that that was what I wanted to do for my career. Because of the fact that I was not enrolled in classes for more than 1 semester at Kent State, I decided that I wasn't going to go back to Kent and I found the CWRU Coding Bootcamp!</p>
